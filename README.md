# Crimes-in-Boston

I explored a dataset filled with crime data from Boston spanning the years 2015 to 2018. In this project I used the Python package Pandas, Seaborn, and Folium. First, I cleaned the data, and isolated the years 2016 and 2017 which were the only complete years. By using Seaborn I graphed this data to come to conclusions about what day in the week generally has the most crime, Friday, and the least, Sunday. I also discovered that August and January are the months with the most overall crime. I also broke down the data to discover that the most common type of crime is larceny, and that the least common is homicide. I then mapped the crimes using folium using a heatmap, which lead me to discover that the large majority of most crimes happen downtown. But surprisingly, homicide did not follow this pattern, most homicides were concentrated far south of downtown.
